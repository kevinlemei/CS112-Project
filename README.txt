Connect 4 (2 player)
12/12/2014

We've made a 2-player Connect 4 game with graphics. In order to play, run the Connect4Game.java file.
A window should pop up with a board---click on the board to place a chip. 
The chip will be placed in the lowest available row in that column. 
The goal is to get 4 chips of one color in a row (either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally).
If the players fill the entire board without winning, it's a draw!



This .zip file should include:
Connect4Game.java (has the main method---run this to play the game)
Connect4Panel.java (sets up the window with the board and other components)
Board.java (creates the board and contains the logic for placing chips and finding winners)
Cell.java (code for cells and their contents)
Chip.java (an enum class containing the different states a cell can be--empty, or containing a red or black chip)
TurnTracker.java (tracks whose turn it is and prints it next to the board)
